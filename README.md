# ROS2 Basics

Welcome! This document introduces ROS 2 fundamentals including nodes, topics, services, parameters, and moreâ€”demonstrated through C++ examples.
I have covered more C++ side of ros2.

## What is ROS ?

ROS (Robot Operating System) is an open-source robotics middleware (not an OS) that provides tools, libraries, and conventions to simplify the task of creating complex and robust robot behavior across a wide variety of robotic platforms.

### Key Features 

   - Message Passing between processes (nodes) using topics and services.

   - Hardware Abstraction to work with sensors and actuators.

   - Modular Design through reusable packages.

   - Developer Tools like rviz for visualization and rosbag for recording/playback.

## What is ROS2 ?

ROS 2 is the next generation of ROS, re-engineered to meet the demands of industrial, commercial, and real-time robotics applications. It is built with modern middleware (DDS) and better support for performance, scalability, and security.

### ROS 2 was designed to:

   - Fix architectural limitations of ROS 1

   - Support real-time systems

   - Be more scalable and robust

   - Work across multiple platforms (including Windows and embedded systems)

## Bascis of ROS2

### Nodes

Each node in ROS should be responsible for a single, modular purpose, e.g. controlling the wheel motors or publishing the sensor data from a laser range-finder. Each node can send and receive data from other nodes via topics, services, actions, or parameters.

A full robotic system is comprised of many nodes working in concert. In ROS 2, a single executable (C++ program, Python program, etc.) can contain one or more nodes.

### How to run a node ?

```bash
ros2 run <pkg_name> <exec_name>

ros2 run demo_nodes_cpp talker

ros2 run demo_nodes_cpp listener

ros2 run turtlesim turtlesim_node
```

### Some node commands 

```bash
ros2 node list   # gives the list of nodes active

ros2 node info <node_name>   # gives the detailed info about a node 

ros2 node list -t   # gives the list of nodes active along with their type
```

### Topics

ROS 2 breaks complex systems down into many modular nodes. Topics are a vital element of the ROS graph that act as a bus for nodes to exchange messages.

A node may publish data to any number of topics and simultaneously have subscriptions to any number of topics.

### Some topic commands

```bash
ros2 topic list   # gives the list of topics

ros2 topic list -tros2 topic list -t   # gives the list of topics along with their types

ros2 topic echo <topic_name>   # prints the data published on the topic

ros2 topic info <topic_name>   # gives the detailed info about the topic

ros2 interface show <topic_type>   # gives what structure of msg does the topic accepts

ros2 topic pub <topic_name> <topic_type> '<args>'   # publishes data of given type to the given topic 

ros2 topic hz <topic_name>   # prints the frequency of the topic

ros2 topic bw <topic_name>   # prints the bandwidth of the topic

ros2 topic find <topic_type>   # gives the list of topics of same topic type
```
